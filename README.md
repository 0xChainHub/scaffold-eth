1. Mint OE NFTs (not sure if we want this to be free? Currently priced, on a curve)
2. You can sip from your OE NFT (only the owner can sip)
3. Sipping your NFT changes the amount of OE left! (only 13 sips per OE)
4. Your address's number of sips is tracked, and if you drink more than a whole Forty you are DRUNK!
