# üèó scaffold-eth - Public Goods Loogies

> Add blue to your loogies and support Public Goods in Ethereum.


## Pre-requisites

1. Loogies: Watch this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0bwE5UelEo).

1. [Composable SVG NFT](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/composable-svg-nft): It's a way to set up an SVG NFT contract so that other NFTs can use it in their SVG code. This leads to an easy composition of SVG NFTs.

## Introduction

The Loogies deployed on mainnet doesn't follow the composable SVG NFT standard and doesn't have the blue color component.

So this is a way to upgrade your loogies and also support Ethereum public goods.

This demo defines two SVG NFT contracts:
1. **BlueLoogies**: They are the same as loogies except they have fixed `chubbiness` and only a blue color component associated with a public good. These can only be minted by the owner of the contract.

1. **PublicGoodLoogies**: 

   These are minted by breeding a Loogie and a BlueLoogie. The resulting NFT will have the same chubbiness as the loogie, and the color will have the the blue component from BlueLoogie.

```
